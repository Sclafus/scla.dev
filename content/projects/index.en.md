# The osu! wiki
I gathered [the Avengers](https://github.com/orgs/osu-italy/teams/translators) under the same organization for tackling the monumental task of translating the entirety of the osu! wiki. Progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/osu-italy/osu-wiki).

# Random Projects
I have a lot of random projects that I started during the years. Most of them had an idea behind them, but it was never developed due to time constraints. They are available [here](https://github.com/Sclafus?tab=repositories).
